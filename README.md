# income-predictor-ml
For this project I am predicting whether or not a person's income is greater than 50k. Some of the data preparation steps I'm going to do are:
        - Finding and replacing outliers,
        - Performing specific data cleaning and preprocessing techniques for a structured/tabular dataset
        - Addressing missingness such as replacing missing values with means or modes, 
        - Performing feature engineering techniques such as one-hot encoding on categorical features.
